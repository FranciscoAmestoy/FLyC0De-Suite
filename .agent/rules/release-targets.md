Every update, recompilation and or rebuild of the project will be done to a DEBUG folder.
Once tested and confirmed ok by the user, then the RELEASE folder will be populated.

The final product to be distributed will be a portable exe file. No matter if it has external dependencies, or if extra install files will be included to populate system folder with required files, the main exe of FLyC0De Suite will always be portable for ease of access.
